<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>Our wifi scanner is just that - a wifi scanner. Our goal is to present you with all the data you need about the surrounding environment quickly and accurately. We show you what's out there, the details on every AP, and give you a quick place to jot down notes and passwords. As a utility we also provide a login feature to enable rapid password verification. The app may seem a little minimalistic, and that is by design. Tons of pretty graphics are great in some places, we feel that just getting wifi info is not one of them. </p>

<h3>Why it's different</h3>

<p>Our app is small, but mighty. We've thrown out the typical approach of giving a summary of a network based on its name alone. Instead we break down everything to the AP level. Think you have an AP that's misconfigured in a mesh environment? We can help you test that. Want to know if every AP is of the same manufacturer? We can do that too. Want a sandwich? Um... we recommend PB&amp;J. </p>

<h3>What it isn't</h3>

<p>This is not a suite, a Swiss Army Knife of pen-testing awesomeness, or a quick check to see if your neighbor's wifi is interfering with yours. We will of course be adding features (maybe even pretty ones), but only if they prove themselves useful and direct. </p>

<h3>Do we like feedback?</h3>

<p>Of course! Please feel free to leave comments in Google Play, send us an email at <a href="mailto:developers@routerraiders.com">developers@routerraiders.com</a>, or if you're on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/routerraiders/wifisurvey/issues">submit an issue</a>. We care about bugs, features you'd like to see, or even just knowing what you like or hate about the app.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
